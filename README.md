This is the code for running the experiments of "Exponential Convergence of Gradient Methods in Concave Network Zero Sum Games". This project contains two files - 3p.py, and players.py.

## Dependencies
* numpy
* matplotlib

## Running Experiments

### 3 Player Games

To run the 3 player experiment, simply run

        python 3p.py

The hyperparameters are lines 16-19. The dynamics are lines 65-66. Both of these can be manually changed.

### Players Experiment

To run the players experiment, simply run

        python players.py

Hyperparameters are lines 9-14, and can be changed manually.
